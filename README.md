The Mattermost AI framework offers an open source, self-managed solution for strict security organizations to explore generative AI enhancements while maintaining full data control, and avoiding lock-in to vendor platforms. Benefits include: 

* **Fully-featured chat-based collaboration** including 1-1 and group messaging across, web, desktop and mobile, with file and media sharing, search, integrations, custom emojis and emoji reactions, syntax highlighting and custom rendering.

* **Conversational AI bot** that can add an AI bot to channels where it can be engaged like human users to respond to questions and requests based on different LLMs that can be downloaded and run as part of the framework, including models from the HuggingFace AI community. 

* **Discussion Summarization** with the ability to produce a concise summary of threaded discussions using LLM models without any data leaving the self-hosted system. 

* **Scalable AI model framework** that can scale up to deploy on a private cloud or data center using large and powerful open source LLM models for group work, or scale down to run on a commodity laptop, without the need for specialized hardware required by typical AI models, for individual developers to prototype and explore LLM capabilities.

* **Conforming security and compliance platform** that can accommodate a broad range of custom security and compliance requirements. With a fully open source and transparent stack, enterprises can scan and evaluate any portion of this platform as well as monitor and secure all incoming and outgoing network traffic as well as deploy to restricted networks.

Example: Watch a minute-long demo for discussion summarization using a fully open source, self-hosted AI/LLM platform:

## Background

**ðŸš€ Check out [our AI developer website](https://mattermost.github.io/mattermost-ai-site/), join the ["AI Exchange" channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ai-exchange), and explore the [peer-to-peer forums](https://forum.mattermost.com/c/ai-frameworks/40) where Mattermost's open source community is sharing AI news and innovation in real time!**

This project is a framework for a self-hosted AI app in a multi-user chat environment that can be fully private and off-grid AKA air-gapped. Check out the [demo from May 15, 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iantien_opensource-writing-ai-activity-7064180683354636288-161h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). 

This framework uses a locally-deployed [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) app to interface with a variety of LLM AIs. It currently supports local LLMs hosted via [Serge](https://github.com/nsarrazin/serge), a wrapper around [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) that can run LLMs without a GPU.

This framework consists of three local components:
1. [Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server)
2. [Serge](https://github.com/nsarrazin/serge)
3. `ai-bot`, a [Mattermost app](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/apps/) inside the `./ai-bot` folder

`ai-bot` routes communicaiton between the Mattermost and Serge servers via a REST API.

## Install

### Local

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed with `compose`. This repository should work on a 16GB M1 Macbook.

1. Clone and enter this repository:
  * `git clone https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-ai-framework && cd mattermost-ai-framework`
2. Start the services: `docker compose up -d`
3. Download a Serge model (e.g., GPT4All):
  * Open Serge at `http://localhost:8008`
  * Select **Download Models**
  * Download **GPT4All** and wait for it to finish
4. Access Mattermost
  * Open Mattermost at `http://localhost:8065`
  * Select **View in Browser**
  * Create your local account and team
5. Install the `ai-bot` Mattermost app
  * In any Mattermost channel, use this slash command: `/apps install http http://ai-bot:9000/manifest.json`
  * Accept the permissions in the modal
  * Select **Submit**
  * If unable to complete the above steps, try restarting the app service first: `docker restart ai-bot`

### Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-ai-framework)

1. Select the above badge to start your Gitpod workspace
2. The workspace will configure itself automatically. Wait for the services to start and for your `root` login for Mattermost to be generated in the terminal
3. Download a Serge model (e.g., GPT4All):
  * Check for blocked pop-ups, or open Serge on the `Ports` tab.
  * Select **Download Models**
  * Download **GPT4All** and wait for it to finish
4. Access Mattermost and log in with the generated `root` credentials
5. Install the `ai-bot` Mattermost app
  * In any Mattermost channel, use this slash command: `/apps install http http://ai-bot:9000/manifest.json`
  * Accept the permissions in the modal
  * Select **Submit**
  * If unable to complete the above steps, try restarting the app service first: `docker restart ai-bot`

You're now ready to use the example `ai-bot`! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

### Ask a question

In any channel, you can now ask `ai-bot` questions with the `/ai ask` slash command. For example:
 * `/ai ask "Write a haiku about perseverance"`
 * `/ai ask "Why is open source important?"`
 * `/ai ask "When were pterodactyls alive?"`

### Summarize thread

To summarize threads, first grant the bot account access to public channels:
1. Open the top left Mattermost menu button (9 squares) and select **Integrations**
2. Select **Bot Accounts** then **Edit** for `ai-bot`
3. Check the box for **post:channels** (*Bot will have access to post to all Mattermost public channels*)

Now, open the message app menu button (4 squares) on any post in a public channel and select **Summarize (AI)**. You can watch a brief demo of this functionality [here](https://community.mattermost.com/files/k4gdq47njfg6uxuzr5toq5eb4a/public?h=_Lu6LPIGENzL15vfKYSw3AId2yKSGAGySMH9nCRBr24).
